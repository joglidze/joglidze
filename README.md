Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm  Angular developer with a passion for coding and a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of web development. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, NGRX, Angular, and Angular Material, thanks to the intensive training I received at Alte University's Angular bootcamp.

ðŸ’» I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends and technologies in web development. I spend a lot of my free time reading tech blogs, working on personal projects, and collaborating with other developers to gain new insights and perspectives.

ðŸš€ I'm highly motivated to break into the industry and start contributing to meaningful projects that have the potential to impact people's lives in positive ways. I believe that coding is a powerful tool for problem-solving and innovation, and I'm excited to be a part of a community of developers who are making a difference.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess, hiking, and exploring new places in my city.

ðŸ“¬ Thanks for stopping by my profile! If you have any questions or just want to chat about tech and coding, feel free to send me a message. I'm always eager to connect with other developers and learn from their experiences.
