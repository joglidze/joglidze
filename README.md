# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹


I'm  Angular developer with a passion for coding and a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of web development. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, NGRX, Angular, and Angular Material, thanks to the intensive training I received at Alte University's Angular bootcamp.

ðŸ’» I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends and technologies in web development. I spend a lot of my free time reading tech blogs, working on personal projects, and collaborating with other developers to gain new insights and perspectives.

ðŸš€ I'm highly motivated to break into the industry and start contributing to meaningful projects that have the potential to impact people's lives in positive ways. I believe that coding is a powerful tool for problem-solving and innovation, and I'm excited to be a part of a community of developers who are making a difference.

ðŸŽ® When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess, hiking, and exploring new places in my city.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn if you want to chat about web development, Angular, or anything else related to tech. I'm always happy to connect with other developers and share my experiences. Also, please check out my repositories to see some of my work and projects.

Thanks for stopping by!
